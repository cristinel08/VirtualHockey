# VirtualHockey
A simple hockey game using C++ and a framework from ChilliTomatoNoodle

The game will start imediatly after starting the app and the hockey puck will randomly chose a direction to go

It's a 2 player game on the same device, your hockey puck will have to get pass the other player and score in order to win

When someone scored, the game will place the puck in the middle of the screen and the app will froze. Will have to close and reopen the app if u want to take revenge

I've worked only in the game.h and game.cpp files
